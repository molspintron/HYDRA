Small script for printing impurity and bath orbitals.
Bath orbitals contains all basis functiosn except the impurity
orbitals.

For bath orbitals: The energies in the molden file can be 
used to assign a given bath orbital to certain features in 
the hybridization function.


Requires:  molden.input (for Turbomole: ./tm2molden)
           molden.bath (HYDRA output)
           molden.impurity (HYDRA output)
