Since Turbomole does not directly print out the effective single-particle Hamiltonian (Fock) matrix F, 
it is constructed indirectly from the Roothaan-Hall equations FC=SCE by reading in the MO coefficients C 
and eigenvalues e from the mos file (or from alpha/beta for an open-shell calculation).
The overlap matrix S is then evaluated by the relation

C^\dagger*S*C = 1.

The Hamiltonian matrix F is then calculated by

F = S*C*e*(C)^-1.

For closed-shell calculation, just compile Roothaan.f03.

For open-shell calculation, just compile Roothaan_openshell.f03.


This tool requires lapack and blas.

Compilation
###########

gfortran Roothaan.f03 -llapack -lblas

or

gfortran Roothaan_openshell.f03 -llapack -lblas


Output will be 
-hamiltonian.1 (and hamiltonian.2 in the open-shell case)
-overlap (or overlap.1 and overlap.2 in the open-shell case)
-coef (or coef.1 and coef.2 in the open-shell case)
-eigenvalues.dat
